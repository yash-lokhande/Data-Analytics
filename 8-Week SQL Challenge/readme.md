### Business Task:
Danny launched a new initiative, Data Bank which runs just like any other digital bank - but it isn‚Äôt only for banking activities, they also have the world‚Äôs most secure distributed data storage platform!

Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts. There are a few interesting caveats that go with this business model, and this is where the Data Bank team need your help!

The management team at Data Bank want to increase their total customer base - but also need some help tracking just how much data storage their customers will need.

This case study is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the business analyse their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their future developments!

## Case Study #5: Data Mart

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/131437982-fc087a4c-0b77-4714-907b-54e0420e7166.png" alt="Image" width="500" height="520">

View the case study [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-5/) and my **solution** [here](https://github.com/katiehuangx/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/tree/main/Case%20Study%20%235%20-%20Data%20Mart) and on [Medium].

### Business Task:
Data Mart is an online supermarket that specialises in fresh produce.

In June 2020 - large scale supply changes were made at Data Mart. All Data Mart products now use sustainable packaging methods in every single step from the farm all the way to the customer.

Danny needs your help to analyse and quantify the impact of this change on the sales performance for Data Mart and it‚Äôs separate business areas.

The key business question to answer are the following:
- What was the quantifiable impact of the changes introduced in June 2020?
- Which platform, region, segment and customer types were the most impacted by this change?
- What can we do about future introduction of similar sustainability updates to the business to minimise impact on sales?

### Entity Relationship Diagram:

<img width="287" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/131438278-45e6a4e8-7cf5-468a-937b-2c306a792782.png">

<img width="649" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/131438417-1e21efa3-9924-490f-9bff-3c28cce41a37.png">

Here are some further details about the dataset:

1. Data Mart has international operations using a multi-`region` strategy.
2. Data Mart has both, a retail and online `platform` in the form of a Shopify store front to serve their customers.
3. Customer `segment` and `customer_type` data relates to personal age and demographics information that is shared with Data Mart.
4. `transactions` is the count of unique purchases made through Data Mart and `sales` is the actual dollar amount of purchases.

Each record in the dataset is related to a specific aggregated slice of the underlying sales data rolled up into a week_date value which represents the start of the sales week.

### Case Study Questions:

**A. Data Cleansing Steps**

<details>
<summary>
Click here to expand!
</summary>

In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the `data_mart` schema named `clean_weekly_sales`:
- Convert the week_date to a DATE format
- Add a week_number as the second column for each week_date value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
- Add a month_number with the calendar month for each week_date value as the 3rd column
- Add a calendar_year column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
- Add a new column called age_band after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value
  
<img width="166" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/131438667-3b7f3da5-cabc-436d-a352-2022841fc6a2.png">
  
- Add a new demographic column using the following mapping for the first letter in the segment values:  

| segment | demographic | 
| ------- | ----------- |
| C | Couples |
| F | Families |

- Ensure all null string values with an "unknown" string value in the original segment column as well as the new age_band and demographic columns
- Generate a new avg_transaction column as the sales value divided by transactions rounded to 2 decimal places for each record

</details>

**B. Data Exploration**

<details>
<summary>
Click here to expand!
</summary>
  
1. What day of the week is used for each week_date value?
2. What range of week numbers are missing from the dataset?
3. How many total transactions were there for each year in the dataset?
4. What is the total sales for each region for each month?
5. What is the total count of transactions for each platform
6. What is the percentage of sales for Retail vs Shopify for each month?
7. What is the percentage of sales by demographic for each year in the dataset?
8. Which age_band and demographic values contribute the most to Retail sales?
9. Can we use the avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?
  
</details>

**C. Before & After Analysis**

<details>
<summary>
Click here to expand!
</summary>
  
This technique is usually used when we inspect an important event and want to inspect the impact before and after a certain point in time.

Taking the `week_date` value of `2020-06-15` as the baseline week where the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect.

We would include all `week_date` values for `2020-06-15` as the start of the period after the change and the previous week_date values would be before.

Using this analysis approach - answer the following questions:

1. What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after `2020-06-15`? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?
2. What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?
3. How do the sale metrics for these 2 periods before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?
  
</details>

**D. Bonus Question**

<details>
<summary>
Click here to expand!
</summary>
  
Which areas of the business have the highest negative impact in sales metrics performance in 2020 for the 12 week before and after period?
- `region`
- `platform`
- `age_band`
- `demographic`
- `customer_type`

Do you have any further recommendations for Danny‚Äôs team at Data Mart or any interesting insights based off this analysis?
