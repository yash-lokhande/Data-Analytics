This analysis was made on Hotel data, which was downloaded from [here](https://www.absentdata.com/hotel_revenue_historical_full/).

The goal of the project was to analyze and visualise the hotel booking data and answer questions like-
* Is our hotel revenue growing by year?
* Should we increase our parking size?
* What trends can we see in the data?

The analysis was made for the years 2018, 2019, 2020, based on the available data. The tools used for the project are `SQL Server`,`Power BI`.
The data contained different sheets for different years with same columns and data types, so the first thing was to combine all sheets and do an exploratory data analysis in `SQL`.
